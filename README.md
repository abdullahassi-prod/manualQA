# Manual QA Engineer Take-Home Assignment - Solution Overview

## Summary
This solution demonstrates a comprehensive approach to testing a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** feature, covering:
- **Test case design** (15 scenarios including functional, security, and performance tests)
- **Bug investigation** (3 critical issues with root cause analysis)
- **End-to-end testing strategy** for a 3-tier cloud application
- **API testing** (14 test cases for CRUD, validation, and concurrency)

## Key Highlights
1. **Test Coverage**  
   - Validated CIDR blocks, naming conventions, DNS settings, and region limits.
   - Included edge cases (1-character names, 255-character names, concurrent requests).

2. **Bug Analysis**  
   - Diagnosed intermittent failures, DNS misconfigurations, and UI/backend validation gaps.
   - Proposed fixes for race conditions and Route53 resolver issues.

3. **E2E Strategy**  
   - Detailed validation of subnets, gateways, security groups, ALB, and RDS.
   - Focused on network isolation and rollback procedures.

4. **API Testing**  
   - Covered authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.
   - Recommended tools: Postman (manual), pytest/JMeter (automation/load).

## Technical Depth
- **Cloud Concepts Applied:** AWS VPC best practices (CIDR ranges, IGW/NAT, multi-AZ subnets).
- **Risk Mitigation:** Addressed high-severity risks like data exposure and DNS failures.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** API latency (<500ms), throughput (50+ RPS), and peak load testing.

## How to Use This Solution
1. **For Test Cases**: Refer to Part 1 tables for prioritized scenarios.
2. **For Bug Triage**: Use Part 2 analysis to reproduce and verify fixes.
3. **For Cloud Deployments**: Follow Part 3’s step-by-step network validation.
4. **For API Teams**: Implement Part 4’s test automation framework.
